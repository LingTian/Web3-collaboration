# PolkadotIDE

## Project Description
PolkadotIDE is a cloud-based IDE on Polkadot. We aim to provide a swift cloud-based IDE for Polkadot without any downloading, setting up, and building process. Our ambition is to develop:


* A cloud-based IDE that helps develop, compile, and deploy with one click.

* A complete IDE that can support all Substrate contract language.

* A Developer ecosystem that helps the new designers have a quick start.

We will provide all code of PolkadotIDE frontend in a GitHub repo with the following open-source license: Apache 2.0.

## Legal Structure 
White Matrix co. LTD, a startup company focusing on dapp and framework design in China.

## Team's experience
White Matrix co,. Ltd was founded in 2018 focusing on dapp and framework design. We have developed many dapps and IDE since we are founded. We get angel and pre-A investment from Cocos, Byte Capital, Nebulas and NGC. We launched the worldâ€™s first cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) tool for the Libra Move Language in June. We have already helped developers from 100+ countries compiled 200k+ smart contracts with our cloud service. We are team from world largest cloud-based IDE - ChainIDE. We can bring a developer ecosystem into Polkadot and help them get quick start with sustrate contract language. 

We made innovative blockchain dapps/games and reach achievements from many public blockchians & IT companies. We got Nebulas Incentive Program 2nd week Champion, Nebulas Incentive Program 1st month Champion, Neo Blockchain Game Development Competition Game Creative Award, Fibos DApp Competition Champion, MANEW Game Competition blockchain game Champion(host by Tencent WeGame, Facebook, TapTap, GameCell & MANEW Game), Golden Tea Award and many other rewards since last year.

We also have paper-backed architecture and system design experiment. Our cross-chain framework "An Interoperable Avatar Framework Across Multiple Games and Blockchains" was accepted to top computer science conference IEEE INFOCOM 2019. Our game design "Rhythm Dungeon: A Blockchain-based Music Roguelike Game, In Foundation of Digital Games"  was accepted to top game conference ACM FDG 2019.

## Development Roadmap
We will build a cloud-based IDE - PolkadotIDE without any downloading, setting up, and building process.

Please provide the following:

* M1 - Research and development of the Proof-of Concept
Duration: 3 weeks
Funding: $8,000

- We will create documents and plans of how we will proceed with building PolkadotIDE
- Build the compiler service and back-end system for PolkadotIDE POC.
- Agile design and hatch on the front-end PolkadotIDE POC.
- Connect the back-end and front-end.

- The POC will allow for compiling Ink! Contracts.
- The code will be published on Github. We will provide simple instructions for downloading, compiling, and running our code.
- Documentation will be created and delivered along with our code according to the Web3 Milestone Deliverables Guidelines


* M2 - Build the MVP
Duration: 2 weeks
Funding: $10,000
- List the compiler service and back-end system with a stable server. 
- A front-end MVP with all the basic functions working.
The front-end will be available in Chinese and English.
The basic functions of the front-end will be:
*Editor functionalities: 
**User can edit the contract in the IDE
**Code highlight and auto-completion 
**User can save and download the files
*User can compile contracts
*User can deploy the compiled contracts 
*User can use templates provided in the IDE
- Test with the community and provide compile service for developers.
- The code will be published on Github. We will provide simple instructions for downloading, compiling, and running our code.
- Documentation will be created and delivered along with our code according to the Web3 Milestone Deliverables Guidelines


* M3 - Complete alpha version PolkadotIDE
Duration: 4 weeks
Funding: $12,000
- Finish alpha version of PolkadotIDE.
- Make IDE available  on polkadotide.com and polkaide.com.
- Finish UI/UX design for alpha version.
- We will provide code templates and examples.
- Ink contract language highlight and auto-completion .
- Bring developer ecosystem directly into Polkadot.
- The code will be published on Github. We will provide simple instructions for downloading, compiling, and running our code.
- Documentation will be created and delivered along with our code according to the Web3 Milestone Deliverables Guidelines.


#### Long Term Plan
