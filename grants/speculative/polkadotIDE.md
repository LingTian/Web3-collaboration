Our ambition is to develop:

* A cloud-based IDE that help develop and deploy with one click.

* A complete IDE that can support all sustrate contract language.

* A Developer ecosystem that help the new designers have a quick start.

## Legal Structure 
White Matrix co. LTD, a startup company focusing on dapp and framework design in China.

## Team's experience
White Matrix co,. Ltd was founded in 2018 focusing on dapp and framework design. We have developed many dapps and IDE since we are founded. We get angel and pre-A investment from Cocos, Byte Capital, Nebulas and NGC. We launched the worldâ€™s first cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) tool for the Libra Move Language in June. We have already helped developers from 100+ countries compiled 200k+ smart contracts with our cloud service. We are team from world largest cloud-based IDE - ChainIDE. We can bring a developer ecosystem into Polkadot and help them get quick start with sustrate contract language. 

We made innovative blockchain dapps/games and reach achievements from many public blockchians & IT companies. We got Nebulas Incentive Program 2nd week Champion, Nebulas Incentive Program 1st month Champion, Neo Blockchain Game Development Competition Game Creative Award, Fibos DApp Competition Champion, MANEW Game Competition blockchain game Champion(host by Tencent WeGame, Facebook, TapTap, GameCell & MANEW Game), Golden Tea Award and many other rewards since last year.

We also have paper-backed architecture and system design experiment. Our cross-chain framework "An Interoperable Avatar Framework Across Multiple Games and Blockchains" was accepted to top computer science conference IEEE INFOCOM 2019. Our game design "Rhythm Dungeon: A Blockchain-based Music Roguelike Game, In Foundation of Digital Games"  was accepted to top game conference ACM FDG 2019.
